# Non-Relational Databases

## What is a non-relational database?

- Any database that doesn't store data in tabular relations
- Also referred to as **NoSQL**
- ...sometimes

## What are we covering today?

- Key-value databases
- Document-oriented databases
- Graph databases
- BigTable

???

Adrian thinks NoSQL is a stupid term and sounds like a Microsoft product.

## Key-Value Stores

---

## What is a key-value store?

- Stores key-value pairs
- Similar to a hash map
- 

---

## Content-Addressable Data Stores

Some key-value stores accept just a value, and generate a key by passing the value through some sort of hash algorithm.

- Git object store
    - Values follow predefined binary structure
    - Keys are simply the SHA-1 hashes of the values
- Camlistore
    - Arbitrary binary values
        - Some features of Camlistore store JSON in values
    - Keys consist of a hash digest combined with the name of the hashing algorithm

.footnote.citation[(Chacon 2009, Fitzpatrick 2014)]

???

---

## Modelling Other Structures On Top Of Key-Value Stores

Content-addressable stores are often used in such a manner; the generated key is stored and referenced 

- 

???

Of course, this has the disadvantage that the key-value store isn't easily understandable unless you happen to know the particular structure in use. If you had a generic UI for editing the contents of a key-value store, something equivalent to PhpMyAdmin or similar, it'd be quite difficult to update.

## Document-Oriented Databases

Focusing on Apache CouchDB

???

Now, we move on to document-oriented databases. There's a whole range of them out there, and unlike relational DBMSes they work very differently, so we're going to focus on CouchDB, a document-oriented DBMS made by the Apache Foundation.

---

## What is a document?

- Each document is a map of key-value pairs
- Generally represented in JSON, or a similar format like YAML or BSON
- Sometimes represented in XML

### JSON

A text-based serialisation format based on JavaScript objects.

- Object (key-value map, string keys, heterogenous values)
- List (ordered list)
- Number
- String (Unicode)
- Boolean
- Null

```json
{
    'title': 'Hello World',
    'body': 'This is my first blog post...',
}
```

.footnote.citation[(Ecma International 2013)]

???

Documents are generally maps of key-value pairs. 

---

## What is a document-oriented database?

A **collection** of documents.

In some document DBMSes (like MongoDB), collections are like relations; all members are of a similar type.

In others (like CouchDB)

---

## Why use a document-oriented database?

**Example:** Database for an invoicing system.

### Relational Database

#### Invoices

| Ref | Customer | Date |
|-
| DOEJ001 | Jane Doe | 2014-02-03 |
| SMIJ002 | John Smith | 2014-02-04 |

#### InvoiceItems

| InvoiceRef | ItemNum | Description | Amount | Price |
|-
| DOEJ001 | 1 | Widget | 2 | 20.55 |
| DOEJ001 | 2 | Wodget | 1 | 8 |


---

## Why use a document-oriented database?

### Document-Oriented Database

```json
{
    'type': 'invoice',
    'id': 'DOEJ001',
    'customer': 'Jane Doe',
    'items': [
        {
            'description': 'Widget',
            'amount': 2,
            'price': 20.55,
        },
        {
            'description': 'Wodget',
            'amount': 1,
            'price': 8,
        },
    ],
}
```

.footnote.citation[(Anderson 2010 ch. 1)]

???

Earlier, when talking about key-value stores, I mentioned that key-value stores that store data structures as values aren't human readable without the help of software that understands the specific data structure in use.

This is sort of the opposite; the document makes complete sense to a human in its native form, even more so than a relational database would. In the 

---

## Why use a document-oriented database?

Some things to note:

- Not an unconstrained free-for-all
- Still possible to have relationships between objects like in a relational database - but this causes problems when querying

.footnote.citation[(Anderson 2010)]

???

So, you might be thinking that a document-oriented database is just a free-for-all - you can just add whatever attributes and values you like, and the database quickly becomes a completely unstructured mess.

Because of this, CouchDB allows you to specify *validation functions*, which are run on every document whenever it's added or updated.

---

## Querying a Document-Oriented DB with Map-Reduce

- Written in a regular programming language
- Map-reduce views specify two functions:
- Map: convert each document to a key-value pair
- Reduce: combine key-value pairs
- Not very efficient on their own, but *very* cacheable
- Only need to update the results of 

---

## The Map Function

The map function is run once on every document in the database.

**Input:** One document.  

### An Example Map Function

```
map(object):
if the object is a church:
emit(object.parish, 1)
else
return null
```

---

## The Reduce Function

---

## Examples of Map-Reduce

- Selection (`WHERE` in SQL): Map function only emits some documents 
- Projection (`SELECT ... FROM` in SQL): Map function only emits some attributes of a document
- Ordering (`ORDER BY` in SQL): Map function the attribute(s) to order by as the key
- Aggregation (`GROUP BY` in SQL): Aggregate in the reduce function
- Joining (`JOIN` in SQL): This is more difficult...

---

## Making Map-Reduce Efficient

---

## Limitations

Map functions and reduce functions must be idempotent, as their output is cached. This causes problems. For example:

> For each church, display the name of the church, the name of the parish, and the parish priest.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT c.name, p.name, p.priest
FROM churches c JOIN parishes p ON (...)
```

### CouchDB map-reduce

- One CouchDB view returns church names and parish UUIDs
- Another view returns parish UUIDs, parish names, and parish priests
- The calling application has to then match them up

---

## Map-Reduce-Merge

- Proposed by researchers from Yahoo and UCLA
- Adds a third step, "merge", after map and reduce

## Graph Databases

---

## What is a graph database?

###Example: Graph-Oriented Object Database Model (GOOD)

- Nodes with relationships
- Comparable to a multidimensional linked list
- Far more variations than just the example of GOOD

.footnote.citation[(Gyssens et. al., 1994)]

???

- Functions like a multidimensional linked list
- Depending on implementation, can be constructed and queried with a common programming language, like C++
- Can be traversed or queried with recursive methods

---

.footnote.citation[(Gyssens et. al., 1994)]

---

## Why use a graph database?

- Modern applications that emphasise the connections between data as much as, if not more than, the data itself
- Primary example is social networking due to many-to-many associations

.footnote.citation{(Angles & Gutierrez, 2008)]

# Bibliography

TODO: EXPORT BIBLIOGRAPHY FROM ZOTERO

???

This is our bibliography.

If you'd like to know more about document-oriented databases, *CouchDB: The Definitive Guide* by Chris Anderson is an excellent resource; it includes examples of building a real-world blog engine using nothing but CouchDB.
