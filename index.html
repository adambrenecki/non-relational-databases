## What is a non-relational database?

- Any database that doesn't store data in tabular relations
- Also referred to as **NoSQL**
- ...sometimes

## What are we covering today?

- Key-value stores
- Document-oriented databases
- Graph databases
- BigTable

???

A non-relational database is any database that stores its data in any format other than tabular relations. The term is more or less synonymous with "NoSQL", depending on who you ask.

Of the many kinds of non-relational databases out there, the ones we'll cover are key-value stores, document-oriented databases, graph databases, and BigTable.

## Key-Value Stores

???

We're going to begin with key-value stores.

---

## What is a key-value store?

- Stores key-value pairs
- Similar to a hash map
- Some can store a number of datatypes in values, others just byte strings

.footnote.citation[(*Redis* n.d., Fitzpatrick 2014)]

???

So, a key-value store just stores key-value pairs; they're basically a giant hash map. Some key-value stores, like Redis, can store a bunch of different data types in the value field; others only store byte strings.

---

## Why use a key-value store?

- No need for all of the features of a relational DBMS
- Only a need to query entries by primary key
- Much, much simpler and eaiser to scale

.footnote.citation[(DeCandia et. al. 2007)]

???

So, why would you use a key-value store? In many cases, we're dealing with applications that don't need all of the features you get in a relational database, and shedding those features gives you something that's simpler, making it easier to scale it up, so you can deal with lots of data, really fast. Amazon, for instance, found that for many of their services, they only needed to pull out entities by their primary key, so they use a key-value store for those services.

---

## Querying a key-value store

- You have a key
- You get a value
- That is all

???

Querying a key-value store is pretty straightforward. You have a key, you get a value. There's no selection, projection, aggregation, joins, nothing.

---

## Content-Addressable Data Stores

Some key-value stores accept just a value, and generate a key by passing the value through some sort of hash algorithm.

- Git object store
    - Values follow predefined binary structure
    - Keys are simply the SHA-1 hashes of the values
- Camlistore
    - Arbitrary binary values
        - Some features of Camlistore store JSON in values
    - Keys consist of a hash digest combined with the name of the hashing algorithm

.footnote.citation[(Chacon 2009, Fitzpatrick 2014)]

???

There are some key-value stores that are really just value stores. You put a value in them, and it generates a key based on that value, using some sort of hashing algorithm.

The version control system Git's object store is one of them; when an object is created, the SHA-1 sum of that object's entire contents is that object's ref, and other objects refer to it with that ref. Interestingly, Git's database is essentially the filesystem - with some exceptions, the keys are the filenames, and the values are the file contents.

Another one is called Camlistore; you can throw arbitrary binary data at it, and then refer to it with the combination of the hash of that data and the name of the hashing algorithm - that way, it's not locked down to SHA-1.

---

## Modelling Other Structures On Top Of Key-Value Stores

It's a common practice to use key-value stores to model other, more complex structures.

- Each value has a pre-determined structure opaque to the DBMS but understood by the application
- Values contain references to the keys of other key-value pairs, similar to pointers or foreign keys

Content-addressable stores are often used in such a manner (although, by their nature, they can't model any cyclic structures\*).

- Git objects are one of four types (commit, tree, blob, tag) with pre-defined structures, which form a directed, acyclic graph.
- Some features of Camlistore store JSON documents which refer to the keys of other entries, similar to a document-oriented database.

Naturally, the DBMS is oblivious to all of this.

.footnote[
\* Not always true - see Eastman .citation[(2013)].  
.citation[(Chacon 2009, Fitzpatrick 2014)]
]

???

So, you can use key-value stores to store more complex data, by storing some sort of structure in the value field. This is often what content-addressable stores are used for; Git has pre-defined binary structures for the four types of objects it keeps in the object store, which refer to each others' keys to make a sort of directed, acyclic graph. Camlistore has a concept of a 'schema blob', which is an entry where the value is a valid JSON object, making it sort of like a document-oriented database.

The actual DBMS usually doesn't know or care what you store in it, so of course you don't get all of the validation and querying capabilities of a proper document or graph database.

Of course, this has the disadvantage that the contents of the database isn't easily human-readable unless you happen to know the particular structure in use. If you had a generic UI for editing the contents of a key-value store, something equivalent to PhpMyAdmin or similar, these kinds of databases would be quite difficult to edit manually; your UI would just go 'here's a key, and here is a blob of bytes'.

## Document-Oriented Databases

Focusing on Apache CouchDB

???

Now, we move on to document-oriented databases. There's a whole range of them out there, and unlike relational DBMSes which are all more or less similar, each of them works very differently, so we're going to focus on CouchDB, a document-oriented DBMS made by the Apache Foundation.

---

## What is a document?

- Semi-structured data
- Generally represented in JSON, or a similar format like YAML or BSON
- Sometimes represented in XML

### JSON

A text-based serialisation format based on JavaScript objects.

- Object (key-value map, string keys, heterogenous values)
- List (ordered list)
- Number
- String (Unicode)
- Boolean
- Null

```json
{
    '_id': 'post:1',
    'title': 'Hello World',
    'body': 'This is my first blog post...',
}
```

.footnote.citation[(Ecma International 2013)]

???

Most document-oriented DBMSes consider a 'document' to be some sort of semistructured data structure; CouchDB uses JSON, MongoDB uses a binary JSON representation called BSON; there are others that use XML.

JSON is this serialisation format that's based on JavaScript objects, which are basically key-value maps; here the key-value pairs in a document describe different attributes of the same entity, unlike in the key-value stores in the previous section where each key-value pair is a different entity. The keys are strings, and the values can be any of those datatypes in that list.

You'll notice that we can store multi-valued attributes inside a document, including a whole object inside an object, which we can't do in a relational database; the implications of this, we'll discuss in a second.

---

## What is a document-oriented database?

A **collection** of documents.

- In some document DBMSes, collections are like relations; all members are of a similar type.
- In others (like CouchDB), collections are like databases; they contain all of the documents related to a particular application in one big heap.
    - Types are usually denoted by a `type` attribute (or similar) in the document.

???

So, document-oriented DBMSes store collections of these documents. Some DBMSes allow you to have multiple collections for each type of object. Others are more designed to have a single collection you dump everything into, and you denote what kind of object you're storing by describing it in a 'type' attribute.

---

## Why use a document-oriented database?

**Example:** Database for an invoicing system.

### Relational Database

#### Invoice

| Ref | Customer | Date |
|-
| DOEJ001 | Jane Doe | 2014-02-03 |
| SMIJ002 | John Smith | 2014-02-04 |

#### InvoiceItem

| InvoiceRef | ItemNum | Description | Amount | Price |
|-
| DOEJ001 | 1 | Widget | 2 | 20.55 |
| DOEJ001 | 2 | Wodget | 1 | 8 |

???

Now, we move on to the advantages of document-oriented databases. One of them is that documents are nice and self contained. Take this example of an invoicing system; in the relational version, we have one relation that contains *some* of the information about the invoice, and then we have this other relation that contains all of the line items for all of the invoices lumped together.

---

## Why use a document-oriented database?

### Document-Oriented Database

```json
{
    'type': 'invoice',
    'id': 'DOEJ001',
    'customer': 'Jane Doe',
    'items': [
        {
            'description': 'Widget',
            'amount': 2,
            'price': 20.55,
        },
        {
            'description': 'Wodget',
            'amount': 1,
            'price': 8,
        },
    ],
}
```

.footnote.citation[(Anderson 2010)]

???

This is a document that you might find in a document database storing the same data, and it's much more self-contained; all of the data is just there.

Earlier, when talking about key-value stores, I mentioned that if you store a data structure as a value, it won't be human readable without the help of software that understands the specific data structure in use.

This is sort of the opposite; the document makes complete sense to a human in its native form, even more so than a relational database would. In the relational version, if you tried to edit a particular invoice using something like PhpMyAdmin, you'd have to go back and forth between two tables, and the data you cared about would be lumped in with all this irrelevant data about other invoices.

This is also a lot nicer to develop with, too; you don't have to do any joins or anything, the data you want is just there.

---

## Why use a document-oriented database?

Some things to note:

- Not an unconstrained free-for-all.
- Multi-valued attributes aren't always useful - sometimes you want two distinct, related objects.
    - You can do this in a similar manner to a relational database, but this causes problems...
    - Or, you can just de-normalise, but then you can't validate.

.footnote.citation[(Anderson 2010)]

???

There's a few things to note here.

Firstly, you might be thinking that a document-oriented database is just a free-for-all - you can just add whatever attributes and values you like, and the database quickly becomes a completely unstructured mess.

Because of this issue, CouchDB allows you to specify *validation functions*, which are bits of code that are run on every document whenever it's added or updated. They can inspect the document, check attributes' presence, type, value, whatever, and then either accept or reject them.

Secondly, the multi-valued attributes are really useful when you have a situation where something clearly *belongs* to something else. Take the invoice example on the previous slides; in the relational version, you're unlikely to have a relationship between InvoiceItem and anything other than Invoice. On the other hand, to use a real-world example from an Anglican Church database, you have churches belonging to a parish, but sometimes still want to be able to deal with the church as a first-class entity, with it's own document in the system.

You can just save the parish ID as an attribute of the church, as you would in a relational database, but these validation functions don't have any access to outside context, so you can't validate the ID actually belongs to an existing parish. There are also problems with querying, which I'll go into later.

Typically, the solution to this is just to de-normalise - store a copy of some of the parish data along with each church. But, in CouchDB at least, those validation functions don't have access to context. So, there's no way to actually ensure that your denormalised data stays consistent at a database level.

---

## Querying a Document-Oriented DB with Map-Reduce

- Programming model used by Google to perform parallel, distributed queries on large datasets
- Inspired by functional programming languages like Lisp
- Written in a regular programming language
- Map-reduce views consist of two functions:
    - Map: convert each document to a key-value pair
    - Reduce: combine pairs that share the same key
- Not very efficient when run ad-hoc, but *very* cacheable when stored

.footnote.citation[(Dean & Ghemawat 2004, Anderson 2010)]

???

So, we have our data stored as documents, how do we query it?

CouchDB only provides one querying mechanism, and that is Map-Reduce, which is a model that's based on concepts from functional programming, originally used by Google. You perform a map-reduce query by writing two functions: a map function, which is run on each document and generates a key-value pair, and a reduce function, which combines pairs with the same key.

These functions are written in regular programming languages; out of the box, CouchDB uses Javascript, but you can also install plugins that let you use languages that aren't terrible.

In CouchDB's implementation, map-reduce queries aren't very efficient when they're run ad-hoc, but when you store them as views, they can be very efficient.

---

## The Map Function

The map function is run once on every document in the database. It takes one document as input, and *emits* zero or more key-value pairs.

```js
function(doc){
    if (doc['type'] == 'blog_post' && doc['tags']){
        // filter out only the attributes we want
        var new_doc = {
            title: doc['title'],
            tags: doc['tags']
        };
        // emit once for each tag
        for (i = 0; i < doc['tags'].length; i++){
            emit(doc['tags'][i], new_doc);
        }
    }
}
```

```js
function(doc){
    if (doc['type'] == 'church'){
        emit(doc['parish'], 1);
    }
}
```

.footnote.citation[(Dean & Ghemawat 2004, Anderson 2010)]

???

The Map function is run once on every document, and emits key-value pairs. From here, you can select, by skipping over documents you don't want without emitting anything. You can project, by emitting a document that only has the attributes you want. You can sort, because the final output will be sorted according to the key. In the first example, we're both selecting and projecting.

It's worth pointing out that the keys don't have to be unique in the final output, so with the first example, we could not have a reduce function at all, and we'd have a list of tags and blog posts with that tag. Then, we could look up all the entries with a specific tag as the key, and get a list of all the blog posts.

The other thing is, there's no way to pass parameters in to map or reduce functions, for reasons that will become apparent in a couple of slides, so what I just described is really the only way to do something like getting all the posts with a specific tag. This isn't a property of map-reduce so much as a property of CouchDB's implementation, though.

---

## The Reduce Function

???

The reduce function is where you perform aggregation.

---

## Making Map-Reduce Efficient

- Map and reduce functions are deterministic
- Run once on each document, and stored
- When a document is updated, only values affected by that document need to be recalculated
- Results stored in a binary tree

TODO: make diagram

???

So, running queries on every document in the database might sound inefficient, but CouchDB doesn't do this every time you try to read from a view; it does it once, then stores the result in a binary tree sorted on keys, which allows it to pull out a key or a range of keys really fast.

Of course, this is why the functions don't have access to context, can't have parameters passed in, and so on. It's also why you can't run ad-hoc queries, especially not if you have lots of data or the database is under lots of load.

---

## Limitations of CouchDB Map-Reduce

The deterministic nature of map-reduce functions causes problems. For example:

> For each church, display the name of the church, the name of the parish, and the parish priest.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT c.name, p.name, p.priest
FROM churches c JOIN parishes p ON (...)
```

### CouchDB map-reduce

- One CouchDB view returns church names and parish UUIDs
- Another view returns parish UUIDs, parish names, and parish priests
- The calling application has to then match them up

???

So, because map and reduce functions don't have access to context, you can't do anything equivalent to a SQL join.

In this example, the relational case is nice and simple, but in the CouchDB case we have to query two separate views and match them up ourselves. And, this is a case where we're dealing with a small amount of data, around 80 churches. If we had a large dataset and we wanted to deal with 10 at a time, we'd have to do up to 11 queries each time; one to get the list of churches, and one on each record to get the parish details.

---

## Map-Reduce-Merge

- Proposed by researchers from Yahoo and UCLA
- Introduces relational capabilities into map-reduce
- Adds a third step, "merge", after map and reduce
    - Combines input from two map-reduce queries
    - Merge function written as if it is run on the Cartesian product of map-reduce outputs
    - Partition selector skips over unrelated chunks so the *entire* Cartesian product does not have to be processed

.footnote.citation[(Yang et. al., 2007)]

???

There is an extension of map-reduce called map-reduce-merge, which is proposed in a paper from some Yahoo researchers and UCLA.

They introduce a third function, called 'merge', which combines the output of two map-reduce functions, thus allowing you to perform joins. Unfortunately, as best as I can tell, you end up having to essentially implement the join algorithm yourself, unlike in a SQL database, where you just tell the DBMS to join two tables and it does so in whichever manner it thinks is best.

---

## Ordinary Queries on a Document-Oriented Database

While CouchDB can only be queried using map-reduce, MongoDB collections can be queried in a manner reminiscent of SQL.

```javascript
mongo.churches.find({name: 'Christ Church'})
mongo.blogPosts.find({'address.suburb': {$in: ['Adelaide', 'North Adelaide']}})
```

Sadly, Mongo doesn't support anything analogous to SQL `JOIN`s.

.footnote.citation[(Kleinman 2014, Kleinman 2013)]

???

It's worth pointing out that map-reduce is not the only way you can query a document-oriented database. MongoDB does support map-reduce, but you can also query a collection by expressing your query as a JavaScript object, with a syntax that's very reminiscent of SQL. You can even set indexes on attributes, as you can in relational DBMSes.

Unfortunately, Mongo also doesn't support JOINs.

## Graph Databases

Focusing on the GOOD model

???

- Evolution of database types

---

## What is a graph database?

- Nodes with relationships

- In terms of implementation, comparable to a multidimensional linked list

- Updates, additions and deletions are performed just like a linked list

- Queries performed recursively, often through macros

- Far more variations than just the example of GOOD

.footnote.citation[(Gyssens et. al., 1994)]

???

- Functions like a multidimensional linked list
- Depending on implementation, can be constructed and queried with a common programming language, like C++
- Can be traversed or queried with recursive methods
- Updates, additions and deletions are performed just like a linked list
- Queries tend to involve performing transforming actions on the database which results in another database graph, usually temporary.

---

![An example of a simple GOOD database](images/good_example.png)

.footnote.citation[(Gyssens et. al., 1994, Fig. 2)]

???

- As you can clearly see, there are a series of repeated node patterns joined together.
- The basic node patterns constitute the schema, which are then joined with associations to form the database.
- For example, if wanted to delete all Classical Music, delete the Info node with String 'Classical Music'

---

## Why use a graph database?

- Connections between data are as important as data itself, or more so
- Obvious example is social networking due to many-to-many associations
- Performance considerations versus relational databases for certain data sets
-

## Performance of Relational versus Graph

- Testing of Cypher and JPA MySQL queries on the same data

- 200MB of dummy friendship data of the form:

| Person | Activity |
|-
| first and last name | title |
| birthday, age | body |
| gender | verb |
| interests (2-5) | time stamp |
| messages (2-5) | actor |
| affiliations with organisations (0-3) | object |
| addresses (1-2) | target |
| group memberships (0-5) | generator |
| activities (1-25) | |


.footnote.citation[(Holzschuher & Peinl, 2013, Table 1: Data for people and activities)]

???

- Cypher being a graph query language, based loosely on SQL, among other languages. Designed more for queries than updates etc.
- Java Persistence API MySQL is a Java variant of MySQL
- Data converted from graph/object to relational with Hibernate Object Relational Mapping, which is a Java library
- REST is an architectural style. Was used in the design of HTTP1.1
- 

---

## Performance of Relational versus Graph

| Organisation | Message | Address |
|-
| name | title | street name |
| sector | text | house number |
| website | time stamp | city name |
| address | 1-3 recipients | zip code |
| | | state |
| | | country |
| | | longitude, latitude |

- Total of 10,003 'people' and 137,000 'friendships'

- Average of 28 friendships per person


.footnote.citation[(Holzschuher & Peinl, 2013, Table 2: Data for organisations, messages and addresses)]

---

## Performance of Relational versus Graph

Example of Cypher query used:

```
START person=node:people(id = {id})
MATCH person-[:FRIEND_OF]->friend-[:FRIEND_OF]->friend_of_friend
WHERE no (friend_of_friend<-[:FRIEND_OF]-person)
RETURN friend_of_friend, COUNT(*)
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```
Example of SQL query used:

```
SELECT persondb0.ID, persondb0.display_name
FROM person persondb0
WHERE persondb0.oid IN (
SELECT frienddb2.friend_id
FROM person persondb1, friend frienddb2
WHERE persondb1.oid=frienddb2.person_id
AND (persondb1.person_id IN(?)))
```

.footnote.citation[(Holzschuher & Peinl, 2013)]

???

- Both these queries are intended to return a list of friends of friends who aren't also your friends. The SQL query isn't complete as it was too large to even be presented in the paper.

---

## Performance of Relational versus Graph

### Results, edited for clarity

| Person benchmark | Cypher REST | Cypher | JPA MySQL |
|-
| 2,000 people | 4,600ms | 180ms | 30,010ms |
| 200 * 10 people | 2,038ms | 173ms | 6,474ms |
| 2,000 people's friends | 7,347ms | 931ms | 3,558,882ms|
| 200 * 10 people's friends | 4,381ms | 850ms | 384,025ms |

- Graph queries scale well when dealing with highly interconnected data

- SQL queries require more calls the more complex the query

- Recursive queries can be written and run once, depending on specific implementation

.footnote.citation[(Holzschuher & Peinl, 2013, Table 3: Person benchmark for 10,000 people, average time needed, average over 10 runs)]

???

- Cypher REST is where the queries were run over a network to the database running on a server. The JPA MySQL implementation ran into errors and was also super slow, so they discarded it and investigated other graph query languages.
- SQL queries would need to be called repeatedly to achieve the same result. First to get all the people's profiles. Then on each person to get their friends. Cypher can do this in one query.

## Google's Bigtable

An example of a specific non-relational database

---

## What is Bigtable?

- Bigtable is a Google developed distributed storage system designed to work within Google File System and be scalable to the order of petabytes

- Bigtable is used by Crawl, Analytics, Earth, YouTube, Gmail and other Google services

- Can make use of MapReduce to query or generate metadata

- Storage is referenced by a row key, column key and a timestamp

.footnote.citation[(Chang et. al., 2008)]

???

- Crawl is Googles indexing thingo for webpages

---

## How does Bigtable work?

### Context

- The storage referenced by a set of keys is known as a <b>cell</b>

- A <b>table</b> is a "sparse, distributed, persistent multidimensional sorted map" of cells

- A <b>cluster</b> is a set of processes that run Bigtable software and serve a set of tables

- A cluster can run across a set of machines and relies on Google cluster management for resource management etc

.footnote.citation[(Chang et. al., 2008)]

---

## How does Bigtable work?

### Rows

- Data is ordered by row keys

- Row keys are arbitrary strings up to 64kB

- Rows with consecutive keys are grouped into <b>tablets</b> up to around 1GB for resource management

- Querying Bigtable can be highly efficient if consecutive row values are chosen for data

For example, using reversed URLs:

```
maps.google.com/index.html
```

becomes

```
com.google.maps/index.html```


.footnote.citation[(Chang et. al., 2008)]

---

## How does Bigtable work?

### Columns

- Column keys are also strings

- Columns are grouped into families, which are compressed together for memory efficiency

- Column keys are of the form <i>family:qualifier</i>

For example, a family of referring websites:

```
anchor:google.com
anchor:wordpress.com
anchor:flinders.edu.au
```

- Access control is performed at the column family level


.footnote.citation[(Chang et. al., 2008)]

---

## How does Bigtable work?

### Timestamps

- Timestamps can be applied arbitrarily or using default values, which are "real time" in milliseconds

- Timestamps are used for versioning

- Can also be used for garbage collection, such as removal of old data


.footnote.citation[(Chang et. al., 2008)]

---

## How does Bigtable work?

### Example "tuple"

![An example of a Bigtable "tuple"](images/bigtable.png)

.footnote.citation[(Chang et. al., 2008)]

---

## How is Bigtable used?

Writing to Bigtable:
```
//Open the table
Table *T = OpenOrDie("/bigtable/web/webtable");
//Write a new anchor and delete old anchor
RowMutation r1(T, "com.cnn.www");
r1.Set("anchor:www.c-span.org", "CNN");
r1.Delete("anchor:www.abc.com");
Operation op;
Apply(&op, &r1);
```
Reading from Bigtable:

```
Scanner scanner(T);
ScanStream *stream;
stream = scanner.FetchColumnFamily("anchor");
stream->SetReturnAllVersions();
scanner.Lookup("com.cnn.www");
for (; !stream->Done(); stream->Next()) {
	printf("%s %s %lld %s\n",
		scanner.RowName(),
		stream->ColumnName(),
		stream->MicroTimestamp(),
		stream->Value());
```


.footnote.citation[(Chang et. al., 2008, Fig. 2. & Fig. 3.)]

???

- These are written in C++. Bigtable API provides functions for everything.
- Bigtable supports the execution of scripts written in Sawzall, which is a Google-made language for processing data.

---
## Example Bigtable implementation

### Continulously Changing Data Objects

- CCDOs may include GPS data, trajectories, state information, wind speed etc.

Proposed 'schema':

| Key type | Family | Description |
|-
| Row | | Unique ID of CDDO |
| Column | CCDO.description | Description of the CCDO |
| | Trajectory.dynamics | Various information possibly including points like maximum velocity, temperature rate of change etc. |
| | Reported_State | Individual state reports from each sensor, such as instantaneous velocity, longitude etc. |

.footnote.citation[(Yu et. al., 2012)]

???

- The Yu et al paper suggests future multi-sensor platforms for things like environmental monitoring.
- Yu et al envision this sort of implementation collecting data over time that scales up to potential exabytes.
- Since Bigtable has implicit versioning, this could be used easily to build up a picture over time.

If you'd like to know more about document-oriented databases, *CouchDB: The Definitive Guide* by Chris Anderson is an excellent resource; it includes examples of building a real-world blog engine using nothing but CouchDB.

Camlistore is also a really interesting project that's worth checking out. They're basically trying to create this sort of personal content management system to end all content management systems, something that can store and sync files, blog posts, pictures, whatever, in such a way that the user is in control.
